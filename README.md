# MySQL-RDBMS -
- SQL Stands for Stuctured Query Language , and was designed in the early 1970s at IBM to manipulate and retrieve data stored in a relational database management system(RDBMS).
- There is a universal standard for SQL set by the Internsational Organization for Strandards and the Amreican National Standats Institute(ANSI), with updates released every ~ 3-5 years.
- Vendors are constantly adding new features on top of the standards, which creates different "flavors" of SQL(MySQL, Postgresql,SQKite,etc.,)
